# Poker Simulator
Simulating win percentages for different hands in poker games, including weird ones.

# Motivation
Many poker simulators already exist. But it's fun to write one, and it's good exerise for concurrency programming. Finally, no poker simulators simulate the weird games occasionally played in lunchpoker at the Sportradar Trondheim office.
